## Blockchain-based Employee Incentivization Platform

A platform for a company to build employee loyalty / engagement programs with the use of blockchain technology. 

The platform allows companies to incentivize employees for their contributions as rewarded tokens which can be given from both top-down and peer-to-peer to encourage social connection between employees.

With the token-based reward points, it gives more flexibility for employees to manage their rewards e.g. redemption for company-provided benefits, spending on platform’s marketplace, giving away to others or even exchanging for cash.

### How it works

- The company onboards its employees to the platform by creating accounts for them.
- The company controls the issuance of rewarded tokens and recognition badges.
- Employees earn tokens and recognition badges when accomplish certain goals or milestones, participate in particular events and activities for example.
- Employees are able to login to the dashboard to check details e.g. balances, transactions, activities’ leaderboard.
- Employees can redeem tokens with benefits or other offers on the platform, share their earned tokens to others, use tokens to fund projects or donations and so on. 

### Additional point

This platform is not supposed to run a siloed loyalty / engagement program for each company only. Rather, it intends to build an ecosystem that allows companies as well as other merchants and businesses to participate on the same blockchain network to build a solid loyalty platform that merges the employee loyalty and consumer loyalty for retails together.
